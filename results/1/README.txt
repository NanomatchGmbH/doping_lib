this is with F4TCNQ EA computed with the EA computed with "ccsd(t)"
note inconsistency: CN6-CN needs pproximately same correction, but I did have not done this.
note 23092024: we suspect that in the experiment the reference doping efficiency is lower than 100% because of the large doping loadings. Therefore, here the corrected efficiency is the one which I get from the simulation as the reference and the other are scaled respectively.
